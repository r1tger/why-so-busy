# Why are you so busy?

For this presentation we look at a simple but very fundamental question: why
are you so busy? Are you wondering what happened in the last 30 years which
caused such a shift in the amount of work we do on a daily basis? And how you
can improve your coping skills so you can spend more time on the things that
really matter? If so, this presentation is for you! We'll dive deeper into how
we got here, and -maybe more importantly- how we can make everything a little
better for ourselves.
